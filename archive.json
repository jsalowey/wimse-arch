The charter currently uses **execution** context, but that is an existing concept that seems to mean something a bit broader, but perhaps it is OK.\r\n\r\nOther possibilities - \r\n\"Request Context\" since most of the time I think we are dealing with the work load making a request to something or processing a request from something, but there probably is a case where the workload is responding to a scheduled task. Possibly its still a request, or perhaps a slightly different context such as \"scheduled context\" or \"batch context\"\r\n\r\n\"authorization context\" - although this is one of the primary goals, it might be too narrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"workload context\" - doesn't seem quite right, but we could define it to be. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Certain workloads can be live for a very short durations of time (nanoseconds) and run for a specific purpose such as to provide a response to an API request. Other kinds of workloads might be executed for a very long durations such as months or years - examples include database services and machine learning training jobs.",
