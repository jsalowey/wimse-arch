I've proposed some new wording for the Agent description. \r\n\r\nThe Server takes the role of issuing Bearer tokens or X.509 certificates to the Workload.  I was a little confused that there was no Attestation function performed by the Server in the diagram before my PR.   I think the Agent would be responsible for obtaining Workload credentials from the Server.  The \"Host Operating System and Hardware\" could provide the Agent with locally-signed Agent-credentials that are not useful for Workload to Workload communication.  The Agent could use these credentials when contacting the Server with the Workload Identity, to obtain Workload Identity Credentials suitable for Workload to Workload communication.  There may or may not be a security perimeter between the Workload and the Agent. ",
