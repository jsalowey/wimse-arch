The charter currently uses **execution** context, but that is an existing concept that seems to mean something a bit broader, but perhaps it is OK.\r\n\r\nOther possibilities - \r\n\"Request Context\" since most of the time I think we are dealing with the work load making a request to something or processing a request from something, but there probably is a case where the workload is responding to a scheduled task. Possibly its still a request, or perhaps a slightly different context such as \"scheduled context\" or \"batch context\"\r\n\r\n\"authorization context\" - although this is one of the primary goals, it might be too narrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"workload context\" - doesn't seem quite right, but we could define it to be. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Certain workloads can be live for a very short durations of time (nanoseconds) and run for a specific purpose such as to provide a response to an API request. Other kinds of workloads might be executed for a very long durations such as months or years - examples include database services and machine learning training jobs.",

I was thinking that the security context is a bit more loosely coupled with the identity, for example a token containing context information such as user name could reference the workload identity.  It may be delivered in line with a request instead of through an \"agent\".  Do you see the agent taking a broader role here or are we thinking of different things? ",

I've proposed some new wording for the Agent description. \r\n\r\nThe Server takes the role of issuing Bearer tokens or X.509 certificates to the Workload.  I was a little confused that there was no Attestation function performed by the Server in the diagram before my PR.   I think the Agent would be responsible for obtaining Workload credentials from the Server.  The \"Host Operating System and Hardware\" could provide the Agent with locally-signed Agent-credentials that are not useful for Workload to Workload communication.  The Agent could use these credentials when contacting the Server with the Workload Identity, to obtain Workload Identity Credentials suitable for Workload to Workload communication.  There may or may not be a security perimeter between the Workload and the Agent. ",
