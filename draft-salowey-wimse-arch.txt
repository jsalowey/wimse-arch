1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Definitions

   *  Workload

   A workload is a running instance of software executing for a specific
   purpose that interacts with other parts of a larger system.  A
   workload may exist for a very short durations of time (nanoseconds)
   and run for a specific purpose such as to provide a response to an
   API request.  Other kinds of workloads may execute for a very long
   duration such as months or years - examples include database services
   and machine learning training jobs.

3.  Use Cases

   1.  Basic Service Authentication

   One of the most basic use cases for workload identity is for
   authenticating one workload to another such as in the case where one
   service is making a request of another service within a larger
   application.  Even in this simple case the identity of the workload
   is often a composite of many attributes such as:

   *  Service Name

   *  Instance Name

   *  Role

   *  Environment

   *  Trust Domain

   *  Software Attestation

   *  Hardware Attestation

   These attributes are used for various purposes:

   *  ensuring the request is made to the correct service or service
      instance

   *  authorizing access to APIs and resources

   *  providing an audit train of requests within a system

   *  providing context for other decisions made within a service

   There are several methods defined to perform this authentication.
   Some of the most common include:

   *  TLS authentication of the server using X.509 certificates and
      bearer token JWTs within an HTTP or other protocol request.

   *  Mutual TLS authentication using X.509 certificate for both client
      and server

   *  TLS authentication of the server and HTTP request signing using a
      secret key

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Threat Model

5.1.1.  Traffic Interception

   Workloads communicating within an an applications may face different
   threats to traffic interception in different deployments.  In many
   deployments security controls are deployed for internal
   communications at lower layers to reduce the risk of traffic
   observation and modification for network communications.  When a
   security layer such as TLS is deployed in these environments TLS may
   be termiated in various places including the workload itself and in
   various middleware devices such as load balancers, gateways, proxies,
   and firewalls.  Therefore protection is provided only between each
   adjacent pair of TLS endpoints.  There are no guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity and correct identity passthrough in those
   middleware devices and services.

5.1.2.  Information Disclosure

   Observation and interception of network traffic is not the only means
   of disclosure in these systems.  Other vectors of information leakage
   is through disclosure in log files and other observability and
   troubleshooting mechanisms.  For example, an application may log the
   contents of HTTP headers containing JWT bearer tokens.  The
   information in this logs may be made available to other systems with
   less stringent access controls which may result in this token falling
   into an attackers hands who then uses it to compromise a system.
   This creates privacy risks and potential surface for reconnaissance
   attacks.  If observed tokens can be reused, this also may allow
   attackers to impersonate workloads.

5.1.3.  Workload Compromise

   Even the most well-designed and implemented workloads may contain
   security flaws that allow an attacker to gain limited or full
   compromise.  For example, a server side request forgery may result in
   the ability for an attacker to force the workload to make requests of
   other parts of a system even though the rest of the workload
   functionality may be unaffected.  An attacker with this advantage may
   be able to utilize privileges of the compromised workload to attack
   other parts of the system.  Therefore it is important that
   communicating workloads apply the principle of least privilege
   through security controls such as authorization.

5.2.  Mitigating Token Theft

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
